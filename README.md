# ChildTracker
An App for orphanages and NGO's with the purpose of reunification of orphans with family members.

The premise:  Institutionalized Children, in orphanages and so on, pay the highes cost.  Often these children stand the highest risk of becoming trafficked, abused, turn to a life of crime, or neglected.  This is created under the premise that the family or a family is the best place for children, not in an institution.  

While the ultimate goal of this is to have a tool for people to readily and easily input information, read it, and generate reports and percentages based on countries, regions within countries, and towns.  The ultimage goal is to use that information toward reunifying children with existing family or willing vulunteer families if no family is found.
